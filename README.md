# Project Topic
Walls & Warriors

# Project Description
Walls & Warriors: The principle of this game place the four walls on the game board so that all the blue knights are inside the enclosure and all the red knights are on the outside. But instead of defending an ancient city, you now have to defend a castle. The knights are more detailed and more stable, the walls are bigger and easier to handle, and with 80 challenges instead of the former 60, there was space to add a few easier challenges that include hints. However, there is always only one correct solution, which can be found at the back of the challenge booklet. For ages 8 to adult.
	
# Initial Requirements
The objective of this project is to implement Walls & Warriors (a board game) as a desktop game. 
We plan on using a drag & drop feature to drop the four walls on the player's desired location on the designed board. Scores will be calculated on the basis of the time it took for the player to complete the challenge and number of failed attempts the player made. The highest scores will be stored along with the player's name. We will use IntelliJ IDE and Java programming language while implementing our project.
	
# How our game is different
To make the game more interesting and competitive, we plan on introducing a sandbox feature which would allow players to increase the difficulty of the levels. For more difficult levels, the size of the board will get bigger with more knights and more complicated solutions. In contrast to the original game, our game will have a time limit and failed attempts counter which would make the game more competitive.
